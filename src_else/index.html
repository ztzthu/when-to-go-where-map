        <div>
          Our Food Balance Sheet dataset contains four important features:
          <ol>
            <li>
              the quantity of food supplied as well as consumed by either people
              (noted as “food”) or livestock (noted as “feed”)
            </li>
            <li>
              The aforementioned quantity of food specified by different food
              types
            </li>

            <li>The aforementioned quantity of food by different countries</li>
            <li>All across different years.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
          In light of this, two questions arise naturally: <br />

          <ol>
            <li>How much food is consumed by people or by livestock?</li>
            <li>What are the dominant types of food in each case?</li>
          </ol>

        <div>
          Food is a major concern worldwide and it is a problem that is expected
          to get even worse year by year due to global warming and climate
          concerns. Nowadays, one-third of our greenhouse gas emissions comes
          from the agriculture sector. The world population is expected to grow
          by 2 billion in 2050, and feeding the world has become an increasingly
          concerning problem. Still, a big part of the grain harvested goes
          towards the meat industry, to feed livestock. 
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          Our goal in this project will be to visualize the share of produced
          food that goes towards the breeding industry, and what is used to
          actually feed citizens. We would also like to show how food supply 
          and distribution have changed in the 
          past 60 years and to visualize dietary differences among countries.

            Using this interactive map, you can visualize data for the entire
            world. For every country, you can see how well people are fed, how much
            food goes towards feeding people and how much goes towards feeding
            livestock. Using the slider at the bottom of the map, you can access
            data for every year recorded. On the side you can see a few charts
            containing global aggregates. <br /><br />Click on any country to
            have more detailed information about it!

        <div class="header-section">
          <h3 style="margin-top: 0px">What does it show?</h3>    
          <div>
            The most striking thing to do is to switch between the "Food" and
            "Feed" modes and see that many countries allocate a vast quantity of food to livestock. 
            In the USA alone, for every person, 1000 tons
            of food are used to feed livestock every year!<br />
            It is interesting to see that this trend mostly applies to richer
            countries, the poorer ones tend to have a larger gap between food and feed amounts. 
            Our charts on the right also show quite evidently that we have way more
            food than needed in the world, the main problem is how it is
            partitioned. Around a quarter of the production goes towards feeding
            livestock, and with this supply alone we could feed most of the
            population. Since 2010, every continent has enough calories per capita per 
            day to feed their population. Unfortunately, we know that many people continue to 
            lack access to food.

            Using this interactive treemap, you can visualize data for the
            entire world. Select a continent to bring you to the country screen.
            For countries in the grids that are too small to fit the name, hover
            over the box and the country name will appear in the top bar. Choose
            food or feed to see the most common aliments allocated for people or
            for livestock. For any boxes without information in the box,
            hovering over it will display the information in the bar above.

            This chart shows how much each continent and each country
            contributes to the global food consumption. By clicking on a
            country, you can see what proportion of the country's food supply is
            diverted to food and to feed. You can also see the most common types
            of food that are consumed by humans and by livestock. It is
            interesting to distinguish dietary staples by continent and by
            country. It is evident that these change heavily depending on the
            growth of the country.
